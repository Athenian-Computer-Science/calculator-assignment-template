# Calculator


## Problem Description
In this assignment, you will build a calculator that performs at least four operations (+, -, *, /). The calculator contains a function that takes two parameters (the values to be added, subtracted, etc) and returns the results of all of the operations. (It's not an efficient calculator!)

The main program asks the user for two numbers and uses them as arguments when calling the function. Then the returned tuple is separated and used. You may choose how to use it - you could print the values in separate sentences, do another calculation with them, or...

The purpose is to practice using parameters/arguments, returned values and especially tuples. 

There is no test code for this. The description above is a starting point - feel free to build off of this while keeping the original goal in mind. Feel free to use different operations (importing the math package will give even more interesting options!) and/or get creative with how you treat the values after you separate the tuple.

Have fun!
